The Barb-A-Watt is a QRP - SWR/Power Meter/Dummy Load which overcomes the accuracy limitations of the larger power rated SWR and Power Meters. It is an ideal tool for use with QRP radio transceivers both in the field, in the shack or during construction projects. The Barb-A-Watt was developed by Barbaros Asuroglu WB2CBA (AKA 'Barb') and is based on the N7DDC (David Fainitskiâ€™s) ATU-100 project. David was kind enough to modify ATU-100 firmware specifically for the Barb-A-Watt to create an accurate RF power and SWR measuring device at QRP levels.

There are two manuals here in this repository:
  Version 2.31 is the latest construction and operations manual for the V1.2 Main Board which utilizes SMD mounted PIC controller and operates using a 9v battery.

  Version 3.1 is the latest construction and operations manual for the V2.0 Main Board which uses a 28 PIN DIP PIC controller and operates using 2 x AAA Batteries.

Both versions of the Barb-A-Watt offer exactly the same performance and method of operation.

The Barb-A-Watt is suitable as a power/SWR meter for up to 20W of output power, but the internal dummy load is limited to 15W.

Hope these manuals help :)
